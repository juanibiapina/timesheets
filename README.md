# Time tracking from the command line

Small tool to manage time tracking on the command line.

## Installation

Using [basher](https://github.com/juanibiapina/basher)

~~~ sh
$ basher install juanibiapina timesheets
~~~

## Usage

- `ts` starts counting time
- `ts` again stops counting time
- `ts log` same as ts
- `ts now` shows how much work time has been logged
- `ts show` shows current logged times
- `ts edit` opens log file with vi
- `ts remaining` shows how much time until 8 hours are complete
- `ts final` shows when you'll complete 8 hours

## Limitations

Does not work across days.
